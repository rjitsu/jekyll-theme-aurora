Aurora is a jekyll theme for blogs made with clean design in mind. It can be used for setting up blogs very fast with just a few lines of markdown.

## Installation

Add this line to your Jekyll site's `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem "jekyll-theme-aurora"
```

And add this line to your Jekyll site's `_config.yml`:

```yaml
theme: jekyll-theme-aurora
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install jekyll-theme-aurora

## Usage
- Aurora has four layouts, namely home, default, page and post. You can make your own layouts too!
- To write posts, head to posts folder, and write your files in markdown. Add the regular front matter on top of your files and save files in the manner the dummy files are stored in.
- For styling your blog, go in assets, and change the style.css file.
